In a digital cave lit only by a glowing screen,
Zach hunches like a stubborn inventor,
hammering C++ into shape one hostile compile at a time.

The compiler greets him with its usual warmth:
fatal error: abandon hope, mortal.
He sighs, cracks his knuckles, and descends again.

Python once pampers him with effortless friendliness,
but C++?
C++ hands him a shovel, points to a mountain,
and tells him to start digging.

Build systems hiss.
Linkers mutter in ancient curses.
Error logs spill out like scrolls from a vengeful oracle.
Zach trudges through them, line by cursed line.

CLion autocomplete, blessed be its name,
reaches down into the cave like a divine lantern,
finishing his thoughts, rescuing him
from the abyss of typing std::something::maybe_this?
It spares him from misspelling
the fifteenth function he didn’t even mean to write.

Still, Zach persists.
A mad scientist in exile,
tinkering with pointers he doesn’t fully trust,
slapping brackets and braces into place
like improvised cave supports.

Hours pass.
The cave grows colder.
The compiler grows bolder.
But Zach keeps grinding forward,
nudging each line into obedience.

Then—silence.
A clean build.
The cave brightens for a moment,
glowing with the triumph
of one stubborn victory earned the hard way.
