In a digital cave lit by a stubborn screen’s glow,
Zach toils like a madman where the lost coders go.
Each compile greets him with venomous roar—
fatal error: abandon hope, forevermore.

Python once spoiled him with gentle delight,
but C++ growls, earn it, deep into the night.
Build systems grumble like beasts in the dark,
linkers spit curses, cryptic and stark.

Autocomplete shines like a lantern on high,
a merciful beacon in CLion’s sky—
catching his typos, finishing thoughts,
saving his sanity more times than he’s taught.

Still he persists, tapping keys in the gloom,
propping up brackets like beams in a tomb.
Pointers like shadows he barely trusts,
headers like rubble he sweeps of the dust.

Hours slip by as the cold settles in,
the compiler grows louder, demanding a win.
But Zach keeps grinding, refusing to yield,
stitching each line like a shield on a shield.

Then—quiet.
A clean build.
A flicker of light.
The cave warms gently,
and Zach tastes victory’s bite.
