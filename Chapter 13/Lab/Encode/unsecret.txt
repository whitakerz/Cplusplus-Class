Zach faced a blinking screen each night,
C++ errors stacked in spite.
Semicolons lost in lines,
Pointers twisting cryptic signs.

He wrestled logic, bit by bit,
Refused to quit or counterfeit.
Memory tamed with careful hands,
Functions shaped by strict demands.

Then one quiet, stubborn hour,
His code compiled with perfect power.
The console spoke his planned design—
A single, flawless printed line.

Zach leaned back, calm and clear:
He’d learned more than coding here.
